        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
           Hello! My name is Wandile Nhlapo, and I am an aspiring software developer with a growing passion for building impactful applications. 
           I recently completed a Software Engineering Internship at Bitcube, where I focused on deepening my knowledge of React and Angular, building on my solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
           My background also includes Java, and over time I’ve grown particularly confident with C#, which has become one of my dominant programming languages. 
           I’m not yet a pro, but I keep pushing myself forward through personal projects and continuous learning across different technologies.
           This journey has taught me the value of persistence, growth, and curiosity. With every project and challenge, I aim to improve and move closer to becoming a well-rounded developer. 
           I’m excited about the road ahead and look forward to contributing to meaningful projects while advancing my skills in software development.
